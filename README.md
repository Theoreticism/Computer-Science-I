Computer-Science-I
==================

Final project for Computer Science I, Fall 2011.

The project is titled Dystopia and is a turn/text based game based on existing text based games such as Crawl or Zork. The objective is to reach level 25 by earning experience through combat. This is one of the first complete and extensive programming projects I ever completed.
